# Generated formatted publication list from Endnote XML

A simple Python script to convert a list of publications in [https://gist.github.com/low-decarie/3831049](Endnote XML) format into HTML or LaTeX formats. I use [http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/](BibDesk) to manage my publication list, and it supports Endnote XML format as an utput format.

The HTML output generated by this script employs some custom <a href="http://blog.rguha.net/wp-content/themes/hellish-simplicity/custom-css/style-1109.css">CSS</a> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/low-decarie/3831049">example</a>). The LaTeX generates output that assumes you're using the publication list in a CV built using the <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/curve">CuRve</a> package.
